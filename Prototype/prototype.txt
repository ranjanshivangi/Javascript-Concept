JavaScript Prototype:
In JavaScript, every function and object has a property named prototype by default.
For example,
function Person () {
    this.name = 'John',
    this.age = 23
}
const person = new Person();
// checking the prototype value
console.log(Person.prototype); // { ... }

In the above example, we are trying to access the prototype property of a Person constructor function.Since the prototype property has no value at the moment, it shows an empty object { ... }.

Prototype Inheritance
In JavaScript, a prototype can be used to add properties and methods to a constructor function. And objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype.
