Immediately Invoked Function Expressions:-
JavaScript provides a variety of methods to define and execute Functions, there are named functions and anonymous functions, and then there are Functions that are executed as soon as they are mounted, these functions are known as Immediately Invoked Function Expressions or IIFEs.
a) Immediately Invoked: This part is easy to explain and demonstrate. This type of function is called immediately invoked as these functions are executed as soon as they are mounted to the stack, it requires no explicit call to invoke the function. If we look at the syntax itself we have two pairs of closed parentheses, the first one contains the logic to be executed and the second one is generally what we include when we invoke a function, the second parenthesis is responsible to tell the compiler that the function expression has to be executed immediately.
b) Function Expressions: It is simple to understand that a Function Expression is a Function that is used as an expression. JavaScript lets us use Functions as Function Expressions if we Assign the Function to a variable, wrap the Function within parentheses or put a logical not in front of a function. The following program illustrates the different ways we can create a Function Expression. 

Syntax: IIFEs follow a particular syntax as shown below:\
(function (){ 
// Function Logic Here. 
})();
